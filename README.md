Cosplay Club is a cosplay contest app where users will submit their cosplay image on the theme/topic. Judges can use our JuDAO to vote for the winner.

- Submissions & Votes will be displayed on the frontend.
- The winner will receive a special NFT Prize & Tokens.🏆💵🤑

## Why?

- To demostrate how to successfully run a virtual contest on blockchain.
- Make contest judging decentralised with a DAO.
- An easy dapp for general public to get a feel of web3.
